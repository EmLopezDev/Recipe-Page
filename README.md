## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-   Continued learning how to write more semantic HTML
-   Better organization within the CSS file. Kept it minimal. There was no need to use classnames since each tag only appeared one
-   Plan ahead for media query, focus on a mobile first approach
-   Figuring out the best approach for media queries

### Continued development

-   Will continue writing HTML until I get to a place where I have a good grasp on semantics
-   Will continue writing simple well organized CSS files
-   Will continue practicing media queries as I know they can get tricky with larger projects
-   Will continue incorporating my information into the challenges to make them more personal
